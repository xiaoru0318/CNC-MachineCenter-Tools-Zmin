# CNC-MachineCenter-Tools-Zmin
This python program can automatically generate the tool protrusion amount in the CNC program into an excel table. 
It currently supports .nc and .MIN. Other formats can be implemented by modifying the code.
If the program is packaged in .exe format, it will run very quickly.
For other required formats, you can modify it yourself or contact me.
The machining center uses the system Fanuc.
